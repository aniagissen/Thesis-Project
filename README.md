Assessing the potential of AI when generation animations for complex medical research: A case study on predictive Parkinson's test

To access the streamlit app that was created in alignment for my third research question: What are the pain-points when using ComfyUI, and how can they be reduced?, please follow these instructions:

create a new virtual environment, install the requirements txt, and run the app

### System Dependencies
- Python 3.10+ (recommended: 3.11)  
- ffmpeg (must be installed on your system, not via pip)  
- ComfyUI running locally or on a server in the broswer  
- Ollama installed with a supported model pulled (e.g. `ollama pull llama3.2-vision:11b`)  

cd path/to/this/folder
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
