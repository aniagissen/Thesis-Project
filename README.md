To access the streamlit app that was created in alignment for my third research question: What are the pain-points when using ComfyUI, and how can they be reduced?, please follow these instructions:

### Ensure:
- ffmpeg (must be installed on your system, not via pip)  
- ComfyUI running in the broswer  
- Ollama installed and pulled llama3.2-vision:11b 

### Then:
- create and activate a new venv
- cd path/to/this/folder
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- streamlit run app.py
